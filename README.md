We all know that every part of the world has their own time zone. Imagine if we could see every possible clock of the world at one place. Isn’t it would be wonderful. Well that is what our project is aiming at. The project is collecting current local date and time of the user. The goal is to display all the time zone around the world at one place. In this project, we have built many digital clock with 12 hour count time. The clock runs from 00:00:00 to 11:59:59 and then back to 00:00:00. Our display has six digits, two-two digits for hours and minutes respectively and two for seconds. Apart from time it also displays the date in DD/MM/YYYY format.
